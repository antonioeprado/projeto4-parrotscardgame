# About

This is a simple memory game made in Javascript. It was made when I was beginning to learn the language, to test my understanding of it. That being said, I don't intend on having it made in a React application.

## How to play

-   You can clone this repo to your machine and run a live server.
-   The page will prompt how many cards you would like to play.
-   Accepted values are between **4** and **14**.
-   Once value accepted value has been input, the timer will start.
-   Click on a card to flip it, then try to find its corresponding match by fliping the other cards.
-   Once all matches have been found, the game ends.
-   You'll be prompted to play again, if you wish to.
